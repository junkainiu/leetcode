PROBLEM = r"""Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element
appear only _once_ and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with
constant memory.

For example,  
Given input array A = `[1,1,2]`,

Your function should return length = `2`, and A is now `[1,2]`.

PROBLEM = r"""Given a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'`, capture all regions surrounded by
`'X'`.

A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded
region.

For example,  

    
    
    
    X X X X
    X O O X
    X X O X
    X O X X
    

After running your function, the board should be:

    
    
    
    X X X X
    X X X X
    X X X X
    X O X X

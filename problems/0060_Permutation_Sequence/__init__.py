PROBLEM = r"""The set `[1,2,3,â€¦,_n_]` contains a total of _n_! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,  
We get the following sequence (ie, for _n_ = 3):

  1. `"123"`
  2. `"132"`
  3. `"213"`
  4. `"231"`
  5. `"312"`
  6. `"321"`

Given _n_ and _k_, return the _k_th permutation sequence.

**Note:** Given _n_ will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.

PROBLEM = r"""Given a set of distinct integers, _nums_, return all possible subsets.

**Note:**  

  * Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
  * The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

For example,  
If **_nums_** = `[1,2,3]`, a solution is:

    
    
    
    [
      [3],
      [1],
      [2],
      [1,2,3],
      [1,3],
      [2,3],
      [1,2],
      []
    ]

PROBLEM = r"""Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list _k_ at a time and
return its modified list.

If the number of nodes is not a multiple of _k_ then left-out nodes in the end
should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

Only constant memory is allowed.

For example,  
Given this linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`

For _k_ = 2, you should return: `2->1->4->3->5`

For _k_ = 3, you should return: `3->2->1->4->5`

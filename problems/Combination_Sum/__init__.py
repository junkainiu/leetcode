PROBLEM = r"""Given a set of candidate numbers (**_C_**) and a target number (**_T_**), find
all unique combinations in **_C_** where the candidate numbers sums to
**_T_**.

The **same** repeated number may be chosen from **_C_** unlimited number of
times.

**Note:**  

  * All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
  * Elements in a combination (_a_1, _a_2, … , _a_k) must be in non-descending order. (ie, _a_1 ≤ _a_2 ≤ … ≤ _a_k).
  * The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

For example, given candidate set `2,3,6,7` and target `7`,  
A solution set is:  
`[7]`  
`[2, 2, 3]`

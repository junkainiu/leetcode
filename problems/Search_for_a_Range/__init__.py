PROBLEM = r"""Given a sorted array of integers, find the starting and ending position of a
given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of _O_(log _n_).

If the target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

For example,  
Given `[5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]` and target value 8,  
return `[3, 4]`.

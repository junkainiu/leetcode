PROBLEM = r"""Follow up for "Remove Duplicates":  
What if duplicates are allowed at most _twice_?

For example,  
Given sorted array _nums_ = `[1,1,1,2,2,3]`,

Your function should return length = `5`, with the first five elements of
_nums_ being `1`, `1`, `2`, `2` and `3`. It doesn't matter what you leave
beyond the new length.

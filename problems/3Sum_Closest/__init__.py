PROBLEM = r"""Given an array _S_ of _n_ integers, find three integers in _S_ such that the
sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three
integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

    
    
    
        For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.
    
        The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

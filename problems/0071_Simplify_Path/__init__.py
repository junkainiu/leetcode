PROBLEM = r"""Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it.

For example,  
**path** = `"/home/"`, =&gt; `"/home"`  
**path** = `"/a/./b/../../c/"`, =&gt; `"/c"`  

click to show corner cases.

**Corner Cases:**

  * Did you consider the case where **path** = `"/../"`?  
In this case, you should return `"/"`.

  * Another corner case is the path might contain multiple slashes `'/'` together, such as `"/home//foo/"`.  
In this case, you should ignore redundant slashes and return `"/home/foo"`.

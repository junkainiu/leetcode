PROBLEM = r"""Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an _m_ x _n_ matrix.
This matrix has the following properties:

  * Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
  * The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

For example,

Consider the following matrix:

    
    
    
    [
      [1,   3,  5,  7],
      [10, 11, 16, 20],
      [23, 30, 34, 50]
    ]
    

Given **target** = `3`, return `true`.

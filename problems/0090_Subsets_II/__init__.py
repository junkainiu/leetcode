PROBLEM = r"""Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, **_nums_**,
return all possible subsets.

**Note:**  

  * Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
  * The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

For example,  
If **_nums_** = `[1,2,2]`, a solution is:

    
    
    
    [
      [2],
      [1],
      [1,2,2],
      [2,2],
      [1,2],
      []
    ]

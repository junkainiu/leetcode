What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution
still work?

**Note:**

  * You may only use constant extra space.

For example,  
Given the following binary tree,  

    
    
    
             1
           /  \
          2    3
         / \    \
        4   5    7
    

After calling your function, the tree should look like:  

    
    
    
             1 -> NULL
           /  \
          2 -> 3 -> NULL
         / \    \
        4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
